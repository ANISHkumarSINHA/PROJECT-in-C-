 Project Title: Trie-Based Search Engine Implementation in C++

ðŸ’¥Description:
Embark on a journey into the world of efficient text search with our C++ projectâ€” a robust search engine powered by the Trie data structure. Tries are tree-like structures that excel in 
storing and searching for strings, making them an ideal choice for text-based applications like search engines.

ðŸ’¥Key Features:
Trie Implementation: Explore the intricacies of building and managing a Trie data structure in C++. The Trie's hierarchical arrangement optimizes string search operations,
enabling fast and effective information retrieval.

ðŸ’¥Search Engine Functionality: Witness the power of Trie in action as your C++ search engine efficiently locates and retrieves relevant results from a vast dataset. 
The project showcases the Trie's ability to quickly filter through strings and present accurate matches.

ðŸ’¥Autocomplete Suggestions: Elevate user experience by implementing autocomplete suggestions based on the Trie structure. Users can enjoy real-time suggestions
as they type, enhancing the speed and convenience of their search experience.

ðŸ’¥Dynamic Text Addition and Deletion: Learn how to dynamically update the Trie structure as new text is added or removed. This feature ensures that your search 
engine stays up-to-date and responsive to changes in the underlying dataset.

ðŸ’¥Optimized Memory Usage: Delve into techniques for optimizing memory usage within the Trie, ensuring a balance between performance and resource efficiency.

ðŸ’¥Why This Project Matters:
Mastering Trie-based search engines is crucial in understanding the core principles of information retrieval. This project not only enhances your C++ programming
skills but also provides a practical understanding of how search engines operate under the hood.

ðŸ’¥This project is designed for C++ enthusiasts, programmers, and students looking to deepen their understanding of data structures and algorithms. Whether you're a beginner exploring
Trie structures or an experienced developer seeking a hands-on project, this implementation offers valuable insights into building efficient and scalable search engines.
